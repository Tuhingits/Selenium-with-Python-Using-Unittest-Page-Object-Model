# Selenium-with-Python-Using-Unittest-Page-Object-Model And data driven Testing
This repository provides a comprehensive example of using Selenium with Python, implementing the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and data-driven testing. The POM approach helps create reusable and maintainable test code, while data-driven testing enables executing tests with different sets of input data.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to use Selenium with Python and the Unittest framework to write robust and scalable automated tests. The tests are organized using the Page Object Model design pattern, which promotes reusability and maintainability by encapsulating the functionality of each page into separate classes.
Additionally, this project showcases data-driven testing, which allows running the same test with different sets of input data. This approach enhances test coverage and helps identify potential issues across various scenarios.
